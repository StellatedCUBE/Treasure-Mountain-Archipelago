# Hololive Treasure Mountain Archipelago Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Hololive Treasure Mountain from: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2972990)
- Archipelago mod for Hololive Treasure Mountain from: [Hololive Treasure Mountain Archipelago mod releases page](https://github.com/StellatedCUBE/Treasure-Mountain-Archipelago/releases)

## Installation Procedure

The following steps need to be completed only once, even when playing multiple Archipelago games.
A single install can handle playing in multiple different Archipelago games at the same time.

- Extract the Archipelago Mod for Hololive Treasure Mountain into your Hololive Treasure Mountain install, such that the folder `BepInEx` is in the same folder as the game executable `TreasureMountain.exe`.
- Launch the game through Steam. The first time you do this, it may take a while (several minutes) to load, or even crash. Simply retry if it does.

## Connecting

Open the “Options” menu and click on the Archipelago icon in the lower right corner.
This will open a popup window, where you can enter the details of your Archipelago room.
On Linux, this can sometimes take a while.

## Resuming

Connecting to the same game via the connection popup, even if it's at a different address, will load the correct save file.
